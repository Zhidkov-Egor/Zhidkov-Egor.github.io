          <p>
            <span>Shut-off valves</span> are one of the most common and popular types of pipeline valves. Thanks to its
            use, it is possible to completely block the flow of the working medium with one or another degree of
            tightness. Therefore, tightness and tightness resource serve as basic indicators of the functionality and
            quality of shut-off valves.
          </p>
          <p>
            In relation to the shut-off valves, they speak of two States – "open" and"closed". The intermediate position
            of the working body may not be provided for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope of its application is extremely wide and covers marine transport, deep - sea vehicles, aviation
            and space technology, nuclear power, and, of course, the blood vessels of the Russian economy-main oil and
            gas pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            A modern pipeline is a complex of engineering structures, any failures in the operation of which, fraught
            with disruption of the normal course of the technological process, can lead to severe economic and
            environmental consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The reverse valve</span> is used to automatically prevent the backflow of the
            working medium.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Safety valves</span> are necessary to protect the equipment from an emergency excess of pressure or
            other parameters of the working environment by automatically resetting its excess. Perhaps one of the most
            striking examples of safety valves is the safety valve installed on a steam boiler.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safety valves make a significant contribution to ensuring trouble-free operation and overall reliability of
            pipeline transport systems, industrial and power plants. It negates the consequences of exceeding the limits
            of the working environment parameters, for whatever reason they do not occur: equipment failure, error of
            maintenance personnel, internal physical processes or the influence of third-party factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Distribution and mixing valves</span>, which are used to distribute the flow of the working medium in
            certain directions and mix it. However, a complete "division of labor" is possible. In this case, a pipe
            fitting intended only for distributing the flow is called a distribution valve, and only for mixing it is
            called a mixing valve.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Control valves</span> that provide precise and reliable control of the working environment parameters,
            without which it is impossible to organize economical and safe technological processes and form complex
            multi-component production chains.
            The control valve in its "pure" form and in combination with the shut-off provides conditions for normal
            operation of the equipment and its good manageability at the most critical facilities, including nuclear
            power plants. Against the background of increasing complexity of working conditions in the electric power
            industry (increasing the initial parameters of heat carriers, increasing the unit capacity of power plants),
            its relevance only increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Cut-off valves</span> (sometimes called protective) intended for the flow of the
            working medium at excess of specified, unspecified technological process, the velocity of its flow due to
            changes in differential pressure on the sensor. The difference from safety pipe fittings is that the flow is
            not drained, but only a specific element is disabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Combined valves</span> that combine the functions of the above types. They have "talking" names, which
            indicate the functions of which types of fittings they combine. For example, a shut-off and control valve
            (we do not recommend calling it a shut-off and throttle valve) or a shut-off and return valve.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Non-return-stop and non-return-controlled valves perform</span>
            the function of a reverse valve, in which the
            locking element can be forcibly closed or restricted, and in the non-return-control system, its movement can
            also be restricted.

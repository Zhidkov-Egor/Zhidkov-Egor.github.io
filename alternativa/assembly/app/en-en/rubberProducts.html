          Not a lot of people think about what rubber engineering is. The name suggests that this type of product is
          intended for use in production for technical purposes. However rubber products are very popular not only in
          enterprises, but also in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can choose different types of products in OOO “Alternativa”. We constantly cooperate with reputable
          suppliers of rubber products, which guarantees stable quality of realized goods. All products meet the
          technical standards of the Russian Federation and can be used for their intended purpose at enterprises of any
          industry.

            <span>Industrial hoses and tubes</span> are necessary liquid transporting, viscous, gaseous or bulk
            substances. They are widely used in the food, rural, machine-building, woodworking and oil refining
            industries. They are made of two types-pressure (for pumping substances) and pressure-suction (for pumping
            and suction substances).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Seals, cuffs, Rings</span> are used to seal the gap between the piston (plunger, rod) and the cylinder
            in hydraulic and pneumatic devices. They are widely used in various industries - from food production to
            railway equipment maintenance. This group includes: O-rings, reinforced cuffs, oil seals, hydraulic cuffs,
            pneumatic cuffs, dirt removers, elastic sleeve-finger couplings, KGD piston seals, guide rings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Technical plates</span> are used for the products manufacturing that serve to seal fixed joints,
            prevent friction between surfaces, for the perception of single shock loads, and also as gaskets and
            decking. They are divided into oil-and-gas-resistant, heat-and-frost-acid-and-alkali-resistant, vacuum,
            food-grade, spongy, porous, and silicone.

            <span>Drive belts</span> are used for drives of machine tools, industrial installations and agricultural
            machines. Designed to transmit torque due to friction between the taut belt and pulleys (friction wheels).
            This is the most important element of most mechanisms, which is used in many industries.
            <ul>
              Types of drive belts:
              <li>
                – wedge belts of normal cross-section; narrow cross-section; rifled with a shaped tooth;
              </li>
              <li>
                – V-belts are suitable for gears with high power (up to 120 kW) and speed;
              </li>
              <li>
                – variator belts are used for transmitting the rotation energy and are able to change their position in
                the V-grooves changing the speed of the driven shaft;
              </li>
              <li>
                – multi-hand belts are used for power transmission in drives with a high amplitude of belt vibration
                (pulsating shock load), in drives with large axial distances, in powerful agricultural drives;
              </li>
              <li>
                – flat belts are used for flat-belt transmissions of agricultural machines;
              </li>
              <li>
                – synchronous HTD gear belts are used to transmit torque due to the engagement of teeth on the belt with
                teeth threaded on pulleys.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Camlocks (adapters)</span> is a system of universal self-locking quick-release Cam-type connections
            that allows you to quickly connect / disconnect several hoses (hoses) among themselves, attach the hose to
            various devices and tanks, plug the ends of the hoses, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Fluoroplast</span> has the lowest coefficient of friction among structural materials, which causes its
            wide use in friction and sliding units. It also has high temperature resistance (from-269C to +260C), high
            chemical resistance. Physiological and biological harmlessness determine the wide use of fluoroplast in the
            food and medical industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Conveyor belts</span> are a class of goods that are in constantly growing demand. The scope of their
            application is the supply of raw materials, transportation of semi-finished products and finished products
            along the technological chain in the food industry, products delivery to the warehouse and shipment to the
            customer.
